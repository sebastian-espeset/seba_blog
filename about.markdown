# Sebastian Espeset

Hi there! My name is Sebastian. 

In 2019 I moved to Chicago to pursue a career in music. Didn’t matter whether I was a session player, or gigging for a living; either way I wanted to be playing music full time. The emergence of a global deadly pandemic quickly shut down any dreams of that vocation and called into question some of things I considered most important.

Compelled by a need to start a career that provided financial security and the creative satisfaction of writing music, I started dabbling in JavaScript. I found I enjoyed the coding challenges and the process of learning the syntax and grammar of a language just a couple levels from the binary spoken by computers.

I enrolled in a full stack web development boot camp called Lambda School ( it has since rebranded to [Bloomtech](https://www.bloomtech.com/) ).  Highly immersive, it consumed my life for upwards of nine months. The curriculum covered the basics of web development from the bottom up; 

- html
- CSS
- [react](https://reactjs.org/)
- [redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- various styling frameworks and libraries
- [knex](https://knexjs.org/)
- [express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)  [](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html)

I landed my first job at M1 finance as an automation engineer/sdet. Though testing was part of the curriculum at Bloomtech, I was far from what I’d consider proficient at it. 

I needed to learn a bunch on the job. Being a test engineer was a great way to break into a tech career because it necessitated me touching all the layers of our application which meant learning [graphql](https://graphql.org/) and having a basic understanding of our backend.  I was given loads of support from my manager and team, and overall it the culture was wholesome and encouraging. 

During the market dip of 2022 all of the automation engineers at M1 were laid off. I’d been working there for just under 9 months and found myself with a decent severance, but not quite enough experience to be attractive to tech companies looking to hire. 

So here we are. I spend my days studying music and software development. Currently dabbling in ruby, python, juce, c++, and, of course, the ever preset React.
